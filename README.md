**YAMLotops** is a personal Infrastructure-as-Code project designed to manage a home network and server setup with minimal manual intervention. It emphasizes:

- **Containerization**: Running services on bare metal within containers wherever feasible.
- **High Availability**: Deploying other services within a resilient Kubernetes cluster.
- **Idempotent Automation**: Utilizing Ansible playbooks that are safe to re-run.
- **Simplicity**: Striving for straightforward, minimal configurations.
- **Secure Remote Access**: Implementing VPN solutions like Tailscale for remote network access.
- **Controlled Exposure**: Keeping services private by default, with public access only through secure tunnels.

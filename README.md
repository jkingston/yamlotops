**YAMLotops** is a personal Infrastructure-as-Code project designed to manage a home network and server setup with minimal manual intervention. It emphasizes:

- **Docker-First Approach**: Running all services in Docker containers using Docker Compose for orchestration.
- **Simplified Deployment**: Leveraging Docker Compose stacks for easy service management and deployment.
- **Idempotent Automation**: Utilizing Ansible playbooks that are safe to re-run.
- **Simplicity**: Striving for straightforward, minimal configurations with Docker Compose.
- **Secure Remote Access**: Implementing VPN solutions like Tailscale for remote network access.
- **Controlled Exposure**: Keeping services private by default, with public access only through secure tunnels.
